This is a copy of the Vaccination Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) database available from https://vaers.hhs.gov/.
I've included all the data files in this repo (w/ git LFS) to facilitate downloading and exploring the data.  I will try to keep it up-to-date, but you can always use the above link to get newer data.

I've included the VAERS Data User Guide which includes an explanation of the dataset, the format of the files and fields and the abbreviations used. It also includes the appropriate disclaimers about the data and it's accuracy. The system is voluntary and forms can be submitted by lay-persons.  This causes a few problems:
 * The data can be inaccurate - there are records that mistakenly have an ONSET_DATE before the VAX_DATE, or that there exists a VAX_DATE and an ONSET_DATE but no NUMDAYS data.
 * lack important details - there are 80k records without a VAX_DATE, the descriptions are often vague
 * under-reporting - it's estimated that only 1-10% of the cases are reported to the VAERS database.

Knowing these limitations, it's an interesting dataset.
